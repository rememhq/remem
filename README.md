> **⚠️ Active Development** — remem is evolving rapidly. APIs are subject to change. Not yet recommended for mission-critical production workloads.

remem provides agents with **persistent, reasoned memory** that spans across sessions. Unlike traditional vector stores that rely solely on semantic similarity, remem incorporates an LLM reasoning step at every stage of the memory lifecycle: from initial importance scoring and guided retrieval to session-wide consolidation and contradiction detection.

## 🧠 Why remem?

Traditional vector stores often suffer from "confident recall of irrelevant context." They return what is semantically *nearest*, not what is actually *useful*. remem bridges this gap with reasoning.

| Feature | Naive Vector Store | remem |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Store** | `embed` + `insert` | `embed` + `insert` + **LLM Importance Scoring** |
| **Recall** | top-k by cosine similarity | top-50 cosine → **LLM Re-ranking** → top-8 with **Reasoning Trace** |
| **Consolidation** | — | **LLM Fact Extraction** from raw interaction logs |
| **Contradictions** | — | **LLM Conflict Detection** between old and new facts |
| **Decay** | Time-based (linear) | **Importance-Weighted Decay**; critical facts persist longer |

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) — Claude Code / Cursor

remem is designed to work seamlessly with MCP-compliant environments. Add the following to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remem": {
      "command": "remem",
      "args": ["mcp", "--project", "my-project"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Python SDK

```bash
pip install remem
```

```python
from remem import Memory

m = Memory(project="my-agent", reasoning_model="claude-sonnet-4-5")

# Store a durable preference
await m.store("The production database is PostgreSQL 15 on RDS", tags=["infra"])

# Recall with reasoning
results = await m.recall("what database are we using?")
for r in results:
    print(f"Content: {r.content}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {r.reasoning}")
```

### TypeScript SDK

```bash
npm install @remem/sdk
```

```typescript
import { Memory } from "@remem/sdk";

const m = new Memory({ project: "my-agent", reasoningModel: "gpt-4o" });
await m.store("This repository uses trunk-based development", { tags: ["workflow"] });

const results = await m.recall("how do we manage branches?");
```

## ⚙️ How it Works

1.  **Guided Retrieval**: When you query remem, it first retrieves the top 50 candidates using cosine similarity on the vector index. These candidates are then passed to an LLM (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet) which filters and re-ranks them, returning the top ~8 most relevant memories accompanied by a "reasoning trace" explaining why they were chosen.
2.  **Session Consolidation**: At the end of a session, remem can ingest the entire interaction log. An LLM extracts durable, high-signal facts, scores their importance, and identifies relationships between them.
3.  **Knowledge Graph & Contradiction Detection**: Facts are stored as structured nodes and edges (triples) in a knowledge graph. When new information is added that conflicts with existing knowledge, remem flags the contradiction, allowing the agent to clarify or archive the stale memory.
4.  **Local First (v0.2+)**: Using `libremem`, a custom C++ engine, remem supports local HNSW indexing and BERT-compatible tokenization for privacy-first, offline embedding generation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Rust**: Core reasoning engine, REST API (Axum), and MCP server.
- **C++17**: High-performance vector index (HNSW) and ONNX embedding engine (`libremem`).
- **SQLite**: Reliable metadata storage with WAL mode for high concurrency.
- **Python & TypeScript**: Modern, type-safe SDKs for rapid integration.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **v0.1** — MCP support, REST API, Python/TS SDKs, basic consolidation.
- [ ] **v0.2** — Knowledge Graph queries, Contradiction Detection, Gemini provider, C++ Tokenizer integration.
- [ ] **v0.3** — Swift/Kotlin bindings, Local LLM reasoning support (llama.cpp).
- [ ] **v0.4** — Shared memory namespaces, access control, and team collaboration features.
